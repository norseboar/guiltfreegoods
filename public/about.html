    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Guilt-Free Goods gives you an easy way to buy from anybody without giving
      up the causes you believe in. <br/>
      Here's how it works:<br/>
      <div class="left_column">
        <h3>You tell us</h3><br/>
	what causes you care about<br/>
     </div>
     <div class="center_column">
       <h3>We tell you</h3><br/>
       when you shop somewhere that undermines those causes<br/>
     </div>
     <div class="right_column">
       <h3>Make a donation</h3></br>
       based on how much you spend. It will offset any impact your purchase
       has, and you can shop guilt-free!
     </div>
