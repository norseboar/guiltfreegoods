Guilt free goods is a system that allows users to "offset" consuming services from corporations they do not agree with by donating to causes that they do. A user will be able to select a list of causes they care about, be notified whenever they are at an establishment that has publicly donated or spoken against those causes, and then be prompted with an offer to donate to that cause to offset their patronage.

Currently, the web back-end is half finished. The project was never completed.
